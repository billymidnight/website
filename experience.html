                    <h2>Algorithmic Trading Bot | Python, C++, NumPy, Seaborn, MongoDB, Git, MySQL</h2>
                    <p>June 2024 - August 2024</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At Trendlyne Technologies, I was actively involved in the development of an advanced algorithmic trading bot focused on executing sophisticated quantitative strategies. Leveraging cutting-edge time series analysis techniques, I engineered strategies for mean reversion, momentum, and arbitrage that were optimized to capitalize on market inefficiencies. My role involved designing and implementing a real-time interactive dashboard that monitored a wide array of performance metrics and trading activities, enabling seamless user interaction and decision-making.

                            To facilitate the bot’s effectiveness, I integrated comprehensive risk management protocols, which included the incorporation of dynamic stop-loss and take-profit thresholds. These mechanisms were designed to adapt to fluctuating market conditions, thereby safeguarding capital while maximizing potential returns. Throughout the project, I utilized a robust tech stack that included C++ for high-performance algorithm execution, and Postgre=SQL and MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring the system's scalability and reliability. Teamwork and coordination with other engineers and analysts was key to establishing results and meeting our goals.</li>

                    <h2>Backend Programming for SQL Interface | C++, Typescript, Javascript</h2>
                    <p>February 2023 – April 2023</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I engineered a high-performance RDBMS emulator in C++, designed to handle all major SQL commands with efficiency. The system's interface was enhanced with advanced indexing capabilities, utilizing hash tables and binary search trees (BST) to optimize query execution and data retrieval. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive test suite that rigorously evaluated the emulator with over 1,000,000 data entries and 10,000 SQL queries, ensuring robust performance and reliability under heavy load. This project demonstrated a deep understanding of database architecture and indexing strategies, critical for scalable backend systems.</li>

                    <h2>AI Poker Bot | Python, RLCard, TensorFlow, Pytorch, NumPy, Postgre-SQL</h2>
                    <p>September 2023 - January 2024</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a Project Team leader in the Michigan Data Science Team, I planned and coordinated the 5-month effort of successfull completing our implementation of an automated poker bot. Using RLCard and PipPoker engines on python, we used markov decision processes and extensive Q-learning to enable the bot to make calculated optimial decisions. With principles rooted in game-theory optimal and exploitative strategy, the bot can play cash games of tables upto 6-handed. </li>
                        <li>The bot registered a 99.7% win rate with p-value less than 10^-4 and statistical significance with low beta against random bots and a 58% win rate against trained bots.</li>
